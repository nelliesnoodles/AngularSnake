# AngularSnake
An Angular deployment of the game Snake
Desktop only until I can figure out how to make it mobile freindly.

An introduction to how I made the animation and tracking of the snake possible can be found here:

Deployed on Firebase.

## Special note:
I only manually added the source files I thought would show how it worked.  This is not the full Angular app.
For some reason I can not get the code to add from Powershell. 

## How to Play

The snake, or small green square will start at the bottom of the game screen moving upward after you click 'Start'.
The goal is to gain points and get it to be the longest snake possible.  Eating the white squares will make the snake one section longer.
Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to change it's direction.  
* up 
* down 
* left 
* right


Game is over when one of these things happens:
* The head of the snake trys to cross the border of the game screen (blue border) 
* The head of the snake encounters any part of itself.
